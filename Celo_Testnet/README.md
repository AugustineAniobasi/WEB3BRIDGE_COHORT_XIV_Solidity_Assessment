## greeter_hardhat
A minimal smart contract written in Solidity (0.8.30) that allows users to store and retrieve a message on-chain.
* This project demonstrates:
```
* Smart contract deployment using hardhat
* Interaction with contracts on Celo Sepolia Testnet
* Proper environment configuration using .env
* Basic state management in Solidity
```

## greeter_foundry
A minimal smart contract written in Solidity (0.8.30) that allows users to store and retrieve a message on-chain.
* This project demonstrates:
```
* Smart contract deployment using foundry
* Interaction with contracts on Celo Sepolia Testnet
* Proper environment configuration using .env
* Basic state management in Solidity
```

# 🚀 WEB3BRIDGE COHORT XIV – Solidity Assessment Repository

This repository contains all projects, assessments, and practice exercises completed during my journey as a student at **Web3Bridge Cohort XIV**.

It serves as a structured archive of my progress in:

- Solidity development
- Smart contract engineering
- Hardhat & Foundry tooling
- EVM-based blockchain deployment
- Celo & Ethereum ecosystem experimentation

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is designed to:

- Track my growth as a smart contract engineer
- Document hands-on blockchain development work
- Organize cohort assessments and projects
- Provide a public portfolio of my technical progress

---

## 🧠 Learning Focus Areas

Throughout the cohort, I am building competence in:

- Smart contract architecture
- Gas-aware design
- Security-first thinking
- Upgrade patterns
- Reading and understanding existing protocols
- Testing and deployment workflows
- EVM internals and execution model
